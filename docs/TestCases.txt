Proposed Test Cases

1) GS Mk 3
    - This is the one described in our documentation already

2) GS Mk 3 High Elevation Angle
    - Mostly the same as #1, but his a higher elevation angle, and therefore less pointing loss for the antenna

3) GS Mk 3 Low Elevation Angle
    - Similar to #2, but with a low elevation angle, and greater pointing loss
    - This link budget may generate a negative margin, which is fine as a point of test

4) GS Mk 3 High Gain Antenna, With Tracking
    - For example, the Ground Station at VT 3m antenna
    - Tracking allows for minimal pointing loss

5) GS Mk 3 High Gain Antenna, No Tracking
    - Probably will have an extremely negative value due to the high directionality of high gain antennae
    - Could again use the Ground Station at VT, but without tracking

6) GS Mk 3 Ground Plane Dipole Antenna, Optimal Elevation Angle
    - Similar to the eggbeater, but with different gain characteristics
    - Optimal elevation angle to maximize gain

7) GS Mk 3 Ground Plane Dipole Antenna, High Elevation Angle
    - Same antenna, but with a high elevation angle
    - Could also use a low elevation angle
    - This would show the egg beater is well suited for a variety of elevation angles

8) AMSAT Example Link Budget
    - To test we find the same result using a known example
    - https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=3&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0ahUKEwje4ZGg5IvVAhVEGD4KHbEpD_oQFggxMAI&url=ftp%3A%2F%2Fftp.amsat.org%2Famsat%2Fsoftware%2Fspreadsheet%2FAMSAT-IARU_Link_Budget_Rev1.xls&usg=AFQjCNF1uEoVwNVy-oGRZ0leY6jJ2Cj-NA 

9) Using NOAA EMWIN-N Budget I found
    - http://www.nws.noaa.gov/emwin/emwin-n-link-budget.htm 
    - Ground Station values are a little strange compared to ours
    - I am not sure if this one would work?

10) Link Budget for a separate completely different system
    - DSN receiving signals from Voyager spacecraft
    - VCC (USIP) Cubesat Link Budget
    - Another Ground Station at VT link budget Zach may know about

Cases that should break the LB
11) Elevation Angle Below the horizon

12) Frequency outside of realistic limits (this is optional, requesting feedback)
    - 100 GHz probably isn't realistic, maybe some sort of warning
    - 3 Hz also isn't realistic
    - Maybe okay between 30 MHz and 30 GHz

13) Incorrectly signed values
    - Losses MUST be <= 0
    - Gains could be positive or negative, but are usually positive
    - Distance must be positive
    - Noise figure >= 0
    - Certain bandwidths wouldn't make sense, i.e. < 0 or > 10G
