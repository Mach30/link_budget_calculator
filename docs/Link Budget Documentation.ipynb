    "# Link Budget\n",
    "\n",
    "Mach 30 is designing a radio to receive transmissions from satellites (a ground station), named Ground Sphere. Link budgets are crucial calculations for determining whether the ground station's design will be able to receive the signals transmitted by a given satellite. A link budget factors in all the power gains and losses in the system composed of the transmitter (satellite), receiver (ground station), and everything in between.\n",
    "\n",
    "The calculations themselves are implemented by a python class named test_link_budget.py. The class models what are generally the most significant factors in calculating a link budget. Many factors are difficult or impossible to accurately factor in, such as the amount of noise a tropical storm may introduce into the system. Several aspects of the budget are averages or otherwise estimated values.\n",

    "The equation for Link Margin is the measured Eb/No subrtracted by the required Eb/No, where Required Eb/No is the sum of the target Eb/No and the implementation Loss. Actual Eb/No is the difference between Received Power and the receiver's MDS. The target Eb/No and the Implementation Losses are pre-determined based on previous experience and research with modulators. The Received Power is the sum of the Transmit EIRP, Downlink Path Loss, Polarization Loss, Atmosphere Loss, Receive Antenna Gain, and Receiver Pointing Losses. The MDS is calculated by summing the approximated thermal noise and the receiver's system Noise Figure. Some of these numbers are inputs while others are derived from the inputs.

    "## Transmitter\n",
    "\n",
    "Whenever information is sent from one place to another, such as when a satellite transmits an image down to Earth to be received by a radio on the ground (ground station), the power of the signal being transmitted from the satellite is a critical factor in determining if it is received by the ground station. This section of the document serves as a guide to determining what the gain of the source of the transmission may be. In some cases, the gain may be known, but in other cases it must be estimated based on knowledge of the components of the radio system used to transmit.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the event that you do not know the gain of the transmitter, there are a few methods one might use to determine it. Some satellites have their broadcast frequency publicly available, such as with the NOAA satellites. This may be on the organization's website, but a great source is the Earth Observation Portal's Satellite Mission Database [1], which contains detailed information about a wide number of satellites, all in one place.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you cannot access this information, you may have to make some estimates based upon known equipment of the transmitter, or simply make a guess for the purposes of calculating your link budget. If you're attempting to calculate an estimate, knowing what the gain of the antenna, radio, and amplifier are is helpful. You may use a conservative estimate for the loss of other components in the system. This estimate may be 1.0dB to 1.5dB of loss in the 100MHz range (or higher for longer lengths of transmission line). This will decrease in higher frequencies due to the need for components of the transmission system such as filters or waveguides to be tightly matched to the transmission frequency.\n",
    "\n",
    "Find the power of the transmitter and convert it to dBm. To convert from watts to dBm, the conversion is ten multipled by the log of the transmitter power in milliwatts. The transmit losses, pointing losses, and antenna gain will be decided based on research, as mentioned above. The Transmit EIRP is calculating by summing the Transmit Power, Transmit Losses, Transmit Antenna Gain, and Pointing Losses.\n",

    "## Calculating Distance from Transmitter to Receiver\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that the transmitter is sending data, it has to travel to the receiver. As light travels from the transmitter to the receiver, it disperses, spreading out into a larger area than that of the transmitter. As a result, the distance the transmission travels incurs loss in the signal. There is also loss accumulated from traveling through a given medium (e.g. air), which we will account for in the next section. Calculating the distance from the transmitter to receiver so that we can determine the resulting loss involves basic trigonometry.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Known Variables ####\n",
    "In the case of a satellite, the main piece of information you need to know is the orbital altitude of the satellite. Additionally, the altitude the receiver will be used at is important, but if unknown, the lowest altitude the receiver may be used at should be used (for example, sea level, or 0 meters). The last piece of the puzzle is the angle relative to the receiver the satellite will be as it rises above the horizon and the receiver starts to receive, as this is the angle at which the most signal loss will occur. 25° is a good value to use here, accounting for trees and other ground based obstructions. If you know the receiver is going to be used from some place without many ground based obstructions, such as a mountaintop, you could use a lower angle.\n",
    "\n",
    "With that angle and the altitude of the satellite and receiver, we can calculate the slant range, or the distance between the transmitter to receiver, using basic trigonometry.  As the satellite travels over head, it is orbiting the Earth, and the receiver is on the ground. Both of these share the center of the Earth in common, acting as the third point of the triangle. Examining Diagram 1 below, you can see a visual representation of this, along with number of variables displayed. \n",
    "\n",
    "![alt text](diagram1.png \"Diagram 1\")\n",
    "*<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Diagram 1</p>*\n",
    "\n",
    "The location of the transmitter (***A***), receiver (***B***), and center of the Earth (***C***) are shown, as well as the angle above the horizon the satellite will first be received from (***ϕ***). What needs to be solved for is the slant range, represented as ***c***. Some of these variables we have not yet assigned a value. The radius of the Earth (***r***) is known. Because the receiver is at sea level, this is also the distance from ***B*** to ***C***, represented in the diagram as ***a***. The satellite orbits Earth at a known altitude, and that plus ***r*** is equal to ***b***, or the distance from ***A*** to ***C***. If the receiver is not at sea level, ***a*** is similarly simply the altitude above sea level of the receiver plus ***r***\n",
    "\n",
    "There are still some variables in the diagram that are unknown. These are ***β***, the angle at ***B*** between ***A*** and ***C***, ***θ***, the angle at ***C*** between ***A*** and ***B***, and similarly ***α***, the angle at ***A*** between ***B*** and ***C***. We have the information to calculate ***β***, with which we can calculate the other angles. Since ***A*** is at a known angle above the horizon, and the horizon is perpendicular to ***a***, ***β*** is the angle above the horizon + 90°.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Calculating Slant Range ####\n",
    "To solve for the remaining values, including the slant range, we need only two equations. The first is the law of sines, which states that for a triangle, the sine of an angle divided by the length of the opposite side of the triangle is equal to the same for each other angle. Below is a representation of this equation.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\frac{sin(α)}{a} = \\frac{sin(β)}{b} = \\frac{sin(θ)}{c}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "With this equation, we can determine the value for ***α*** given the information we already know. \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\frac{sin(α)}{a} = \\frac{sin(β)}{b}$$\n",
    "$$sin(α) = a * \\frac{sin(β)}{b}$$\n",
    "$$sin(α) = \\frac{a}{b} * sin(β)$$\n",
    "$$α = sin^{-1}\\bigg(\\frac{a}{b} * sin(β)\\bigg)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The other equation is the fact that the sum of the inner angles of a triangle are equal to 180. Below is a representation of this equation. \n",
    "\n",
    "$$180 = α + β + θ$$\n",
    "\n",
    "With this equation, when two of the angles are known, the third can be calculated using subtraction. This equation is subsequently used to calculate ***θ***. With ***θ*** known, law of sines again can be used to calculate ***c***.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can now represent all of the information we have, as well as the equations to solve for the as yet unknowns. The table below lists all this information.\n",

    "#### Free Space Path Loss\n",
    " \n",
    "The Link Distance was calculated for in the section above. Downlink Free Space Path Loss follows an inverse distance squared relationship. To calculate in dB, multiply ten by the log of 4${\\pi}$ multipled by the link distance divided by the signal wavelength quantity squared. Polarization Loss is zero in this example because both antennas are right hand circularly polarized (RHCP). As a counterexample, if one of the antennas is circularly polarized and the other antennas is linearly polarized, the polarization loss would be around 3 [dB].\n",
    "\n",
    "$$L_{Path} = (\\frac{4{\\pi}*D}{\\lambda})^2$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$L_{Path(dB)} = -10log_{10}(L_{Path}) = -10log_{10}((\\frac{4{\\pi}*D}{\\lambda})^2)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Atmospheric Losses\n",
    "Losses due to atmospheric gases (Nitrogen, Oxygen, Carbon Dioxide, Hydrogen, etc.) are nearly independent of atmospheric temperature, mean density and relative humidity at frequencies below 2 GHz.  Atmospheric absorption depends strongly upon the total number of molecules distributed along the path between the spacecraft and the ground station.  This, in turn, means that the losses from or to the satellite are elevation angle dependent.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n",
    "\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n",
    "The data used here  is taken from \"Radiowave Propagation in Satellite Communications\" by\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n",
    "Louis J. Ippolito, Jr., Van Nostrand-Reinhold, 1986, pp. 33-34, Tables 3-3a-c. If you are using uplink or downlink frequencies above 2 GHz, refer to the referenced text given above to determine the appropriate atmospheric losses.\n",
    "\n",
    "The table below is a look-up table. Users should choose the loss value closest to the chosen elevation angle of interest available. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "|Elevation Angle|Loss|Unit|\n",

    "#### Doppler Shift\n",
    "Doppler shift must be accounted for when designing satellite communication links. A doppler shift is a translation in frequency for a signal transmitted from an object with non-zero line-of-sight velocity relative to the receiver. As a transmitter moves, the wavelength of the transmitted signal increases or decreases depending if it is moving away or towards the receiver. All satellites with the noticeable exception of those in geostationary orbit will experience doppler shifts for uplink and downlink transmissions. The frequency shift of a signal received from a moving transmitter and a moving receiver can be calculated from the following equation.\n",
    "\n",
    "$${FrequencyReceived} = \\frac{(SpeedofLight+ReceiverVelocity)*FrequencyTransmitted}{SpeedofLight+TransmitterVelocity}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The doppler shift profile for a typical satellite pass-over is displayed below. The steepness of the curve depends on the altitude of the satellite and the center frequency of the transmitted signal. Higher signal center frequencies have more doppler shift than lower frequency signals. Satellites in lower orbit move around the Earth faster than higher orbiting satellites and therefore have higher max doppler shift. Observing the plot more closely, the doppler shift is greater at lower elevation angles and is not changing quickly. When the satellite approaches the highest elevation angle in its flyover path, the opposite is true. The satellite doppler shift approaches zero and is rapidly changing.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Satellite_Doppler_shift.png](attachment:Satellite_Doppler_shift.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Doppler Shift Compensation\n",
    "•\tAdjust center frequency tuning of either transmitter or receiver based on predicted doppler shift predetermined by satellite orbital path trajectory\n",
    "\n",
    "•\tOversample down-converted doppler shifted RF signal to encompass whole bandwidth of predicted doppler shift and compensate \n",
    "for doppler shift digitally. This requires a receiver with larger bandwidth compared to the actual baseband signal. \n",
    "\n",
    "•\tImplement a frequency tracking phased locked loop which locks on to carrier signal and automatically tunes to received signal center frequency\n",
    "\n",
    "•\tUtilize software to detect center frequency offset of received signal and retune the receiver accordingly \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Radio Propagation Factors Beyond the Scope of the Design Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Multipath Fading\n",
    "Inherent to all wireless radio communication channels is multipath propagation. When radio waves are transmitted from an antenna, different portions of the wave-front travelling away will usually interact with different obstacles. The sum of a fraction of these waves will reach the receiver, along with the direct line-of-sight component if it exists. These interactions are primarily reflection, refraction, diffraction, and scattering. In land based communication systems, radio wave can interact with objects of all sizes including terrain, buildings, cars, and people. How detrimental multipath propagation is to a receiver is location dependent. Amazingly, the atmosphere can refract and scatter radio waves as they travel from space to Earth’s surface. This can be attributed to changing refractive indices associated with different air pressures and temperatures at different altitudes as well as clouds between the satellite and ground station. The total electron content (TEC) is a common metric used to determine propagation delay due to the ionosphere. The “richness” for a multipath propagation channel is related to the inter-symbol interference experienced by the desired receiver. Inter-symbol interference occurs when a previously transmitted symbol interferes with the consecutive transmitted symbol due to delayed components of the previous signal. This type of interference can severely affect receiver performance in high multipath environments. \n",

    "##### Realistic Free Space Path Loss Exponent\n",
    "The free space path loss of a signal is usually expressed as an equation directly dependent on the distance between receiver and transmitter antenna squared. This usually refers to the power of an isotropic antenna radiating in all directions from a point source equally. In reality, the free space path loss exponent is usually a value between 2 and 4. The realistic free space path loss can be affected by atmospheric conditions, multipath, fading, and many other factors. In satellite communications, the physical conditions of the atmosphere change drastically with respect to temperature, density, transparency, and composition. The ionosphere, which has varying levels of ionization depending on altitude and time of day affect long-wavelength radio signals the most. Radio waves can be reflected or absorbed by the ionosphere. To derive the true free space path loss, multiple calculations with respect to the varying parameters must be considered. Many sophisticated models such as the Irregular Terrain Model (ITM) have been created to describe realistic path losses using empirical data and statistical models. \n",
    "\n",
    "##### Fading\n",
    "Fading is the time-dependent variation of received signal strength which may be due to multiple conditions or events. Fading can be described as fast or slow depending on the variation of signal power over a symbol time. As described above, multipath is a major source of fading in signal strength due to constructive and destructive interference. However, other factors include scattering and diffraction of electromagnetic waves. A moving receiver and or transmitter will also induce fading due to signal strength changing significantly every quarter wavelength.\n",

    "Receiver Antenna Gain is the peak gain of the antenna, which is calculated through electromagnetic modeling and/or testing at the signal frequency. This value determined is through research and extended knowledge from known values of existing eggbeater antennae. The current design choice for Ground Sphere, an eggbeater antenna, will be used in our examples.\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Amplification\n",
    "\n",
    "If the desired antenna does not have sufficient gain to achieve the required Eb/No value, a Low Noise Amplifier (LNA) can be used to increase signal strength. Adding a LNA close to the antenna will amplify the signal without generating too much additional noise. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Radio\n",
    "\n",
    "To interpret the radio frequency signal as data, a hardware or software radio may be used. Software radios are ever growing in popularity and can be purchased for reasonably low prices. Software radios can be configured to decode a range of frequencies and modulation schemes on the fly -- making them an excellent purchase for use in varying radio frequency projects. Hardware radios are better at accomplishing specific tasks and may be cheaper overall, but their functionality is limited."

    "Case 10 is an example link budget using the Global Positioning System (GPS). The transmitter and signal characteristics are well-documented and can be applied to our link budget for verification. Please note that the link margin is negative due to not taking into account the processing gain due to large amount of coding overhead. GPS utilizes spread specrum code division multiplexing in order for receivers to distinguish among different GPS satellites. It accomplishes this by multiplying the satellite data sigal with a psuedorandom code signal unique to each satellite. Using corellation, receivers can back out from the same channel which satelites are in view of the antenna.\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of this test case is to validate our library with an existing link budget for an entirely different system. \n",

    "### Edge Cases\n",
    "\n",
    "This section of test cases include edge cases that should cause the calculations to misbehave. This includes unrealistic values for our Ground Sphere Mk. 3 design. Some of these edge cases should throw errors while some should somehow warn the user that there could be issues with the calculation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once an error is reached, the calculation will stop, which leaves all remaining values incorrect.\n",
